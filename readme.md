This was a project that I collaborated on while at the university of pittsburgh.
This parallel parks a robotic car (lego mindstorms). It uses PID logic in conjunction with photocell sensors in order to follow a line
(e.g. drive on a path) and an infrared sensor to find suitable parking spaces. Then geometry is used to actually park the car in the
potential spot.
